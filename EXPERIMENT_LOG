Monday, Feb 6: ran first experiment
MTurk ID 2I63W5XH0JPPYT85BMGLVP75SV1KEG
Cost: $5.50 max, about half of that expected.

Conditions: none to speak of really, just running an experiment to get started and make sure that everything is ironed out. Haven't written the code to pay out bonuses and accept, or to automate the experiment process - that'll come next.

Result: A couple of turkers were able to get in double-dips. Learned how to fix that, will implement next, as well as looking at the ratings and correlation between accepting/rejecting and amt offered, and review/amt offered.

Analysis: Mean squared error (though we'll need to adjust moving forward) was 0.99, and the resulting chart looks like <LINK>.
Also, I'm currently throwing away did-not-reviews, which does not seem like a useful analysis trick. Hopefully I'll find a better alternative moving forward.
