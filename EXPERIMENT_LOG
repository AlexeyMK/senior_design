MTurk ID 2I63W5XH0JPPYT85BMGLVP75SV1KEG
Cost: $5.50 max, about half of that expected.

Conditions: none to speak of really, just running an experiment to get started and make sure that everything is ironed out. Haven't written the code to pay out bonuses and accept, or to automate the experiment process - that'll come next.
