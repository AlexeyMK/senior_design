<p>Welcome to our marketplace simulation, thank you for participating.
There are two roles: offerer and receiver.
</p>
<!-- TODO: parametrize funding amound and # rounds -->
<p>You will then play 5 games of the marketplace experiment. Here is how it works:</p>

<p>The offerer receives 10 cents and makes a decision about how to distribute the money between the offerer and the receiver, offering (for example) 5 cents each, or 8 cents to the reciever and 2 cents to the offerer.</p>

<p>The receiver may choose to accept or reject the offer. If the receiver accepts, both parties will receive their parts as a bonus for the experiment. If the receiver rejects, neither party will receive a bonus for that round.</p>

<p>
{% if conditions.review_will_be_anonymous == "anonymous" %}
  Your reviews will <strong>not be shared</strong> with the other party.
{% elif conditions.review_will_be_anonymous == "public" %}
    Your reviews <strong>will be shared</strong> with the other party.
{% endif %}
</p>

{% if conditions.review_is_mandatory %}
<p>
Leaving a review is mandatory.
</p>
{% endif %}

{% if not in_preview_mode %}
<p>You have been selected to be: <strong>the receiver</strong>.</p>
