Initial TODO:

- add Jinja2 to CherryPy
- get hosting somewhere (pennapps for now)
- test on mturk testing env, manually
- pick backend (mysql's easy enough) and integrate with SQLAlchemy or SQLObject, etc
- test on mturk test env, saving data

- boto scripts for putting up projects (re-use old code)

- Set up Boto to deal with the mechanical turk API

- Get Proof of Concept working: 
  - Run a script --> creates a task in (for now, fake) environment 
  - User comes to task --> plays game, makes decision, saved
  - User got paid & database has state of 'user played game & results' saved
