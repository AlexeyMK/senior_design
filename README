Initial TODO:

- Set up Cherry.py app that serves 'game' front-end
- Set up Boto to deal with the mechanical turk API
- Set up a mysqlite or mysql (or something fun and noSQL-y) database backend to save results and maintain state

- Get Proof of Concept working: 
  - Run a script --> creates a task in (for now, fake) environment 
  - User comes to task --> plays game, makes decision, saved
  - User got paid & database has state of 'user played game & results' saved
