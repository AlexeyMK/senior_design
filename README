To run locally, use (once you have the Google App Engine SDK installed):
> dev_appserver.py . 

Initial TODO:

x add Jinja2 to CherryPy
x get hosting somewhere (google app engine. NOTE - to setup, download GAE python stuff and symlink your cherrypy/jinja2 install locally)
x pick backend (mysql's easy enough) and integrate with SQLAlchemy or SQLObject, etc # ended up picking Google App Engine's ORM)
- test on mturk testing env, manually
- test on mturk test env, saving data

- boto scripts for putting up projects (re-use old code)

- Set up Boto to deal with the mechanical turk API

- Get Proof of Concept working: 
  - Run a script --> creates a task in (for now, fake) environment 
  - User comes to task --> plays game, makes decision, saved
  - User got paid & database has state of 'user played game & results' saved
